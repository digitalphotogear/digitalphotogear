Digital Photo Gear makes it easy to figure out in minutes exactly what camera equipment makes sense for the type of photography you plan to do and budget that you have.

### Introduction

Phone cameras have advanced greatly within the last few years due to increased sensor sizes and computational photography to the point where I don't bring my mirrorless camera on vacation unless I'm shooting wildlife or looking to take top tier photos. I'd highly recommend first picking up a cell phone with a fantastic 3 camera setup. This is the one camera you will always have on you, so it's better to choose a great one.

DSLRs and mirrorless cameras will be a step up in many ways from the best camera phones especially in terms of their sensor size for gathering lower light and higher dynamic range and their ability to swap lenses.

Fixed lens cameras do still have a time and place, although are being squashed out by the increased performance of camera phones and are pretty much displaced for normal use. One remaining use of fixed lens cameras is during concerts and sports events where detachable lens cameras are banned.
