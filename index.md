Digital Photo Gear makes it easy to figure out in minutes exactly what camera equipment makes sense for the type of photography you plan to do and budget that you have.

### Introduction

Phone cameras have advanced greatly within the last few years to the point where I don't bring along my mirrorless camera on vacation unless I'm shooting wildlife or looking to take top tier photos. I'd highly recommend first picking up a cell phone with a fantastic camera. This is the one camera you will always have on you, so it's better to not cheap out.
