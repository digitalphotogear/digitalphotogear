Digital Photo Gear makes it easy to figure out in minutes what camera equipment makes sense for the type of photography you plan to do and budget that you have. Researching the internet or other sites can easily take hours or days.

### Introduction

Phone cameras have advanced greatly within the last few years due to increased sensor sizes and computational photography to the point where I don't bring my mirrorless camera on vacation unless I'm shooting wildlife or looking to take top tier photos. I'd highly recommend first picking up a cell phone with a fantastic 3 camera setup. This is the one camera you will always have on you, so it's better to choose a great one.

DSLRs and mirrorless cameras will be a step up in many ways from the best camera phones especially in terms of their sensor size for gathering more detail, lower light and higher dynamic range and their ability to swap lenses.

Fixed lens cameras do still have a time and place, although they are being squashed out by the increased performance of camera phones and are pretty much obsolete for most uses. One remaining use of fixed lens cameras is during concerts and sports events where detachable lens cameras are banned but you need a longer zoom than a camera phone can provide.
