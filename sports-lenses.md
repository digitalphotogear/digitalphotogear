The best sports lenses tend to be zoom lenses in the range of 70mm to 300mm and have a big aperture to capture fast action. The general sports lens tends to be the 70-200 F2.8. You can get away with a F4-F5.6 lens in daytime light where some of the general telephoto lenses could work. For extremely dark shooting many switch over to a 85m or 105mm F1.4 lens.
